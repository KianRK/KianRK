- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KianRK
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in backend development, machine/deep learning, robotics, IoT.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Java and also Python, because I want to dig into machine/deep learning, when my schedule allows for it. Also I want to get more familiar with Git/GitHub to manage some private projects.
