- 👋 Hi, I’m @KianRK
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, frontend app development, machine learning, IoT.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Java and also Python, because I want to dig into machine/ deep learning, when my schedule allows for it. Also I want to get more familiar with Git/GitHub to manage some private projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything I can contribute to.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
